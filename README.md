# HW 45 solution
## Introducing read / write locks for multithreading environment
## Provides maximal concurrency
## Operations not updating map's may run simultaneously

# HW 45 Definition
## FIXME introduce synchronization policy with the maximal concurrency
## Operations of not updating should run simultaneously  

# CW 34
## introducing of json.org library for working with JSON objects in JAVA
## Writing methods toString() and fillJSON for classes Employee and Manager
## Writing methods getEmployeeFromJSON and setObject in the classes Employee and Manager
## Introducing interface Persistable
## tests for Interface Persistable
## tests for JSON's

# HW 34
## Filling TODO's comments
## fillJSON for SalesPerson and WageEmployee
## setObject for SalesPerson and WageEmployee
## methods of the Interface Persistable
## make sure the all tests passed 

# CW 30
## infrastructure for HW 30
### Interface
### implementation data structure
### all classes
### all tests

# HW 30
## write all implementation methods in most effective way by applying appropriate Map objects in data structure
## make sure all tests pass
